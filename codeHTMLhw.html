            A film, also called a movie, motion picture or moving picture, is a work of visual art used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas,
             <br>stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images. These images are generally accompanied by sound, 
             <br>and more rarely, other sensory stimulations.[1] The word "cinema", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the 
             <br>film industry, and to the art form that is the result of it.

            <h1>Why watch movies?</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
            Movies allow us to explore our minds -- to experience and feel things we wouldn't normally feel within the real world, 
            <br>to escape reality. ... We watch films to feel something  love, fear, escape, peril... 
            <br>Most directors will tell you that their job is not to entertain others, but to tell a story.
